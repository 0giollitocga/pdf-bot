## How to Use Aridi Vector Clipart in Your Projects
 
One of the advantages of using vector clipart is that you can easily resize, edit, and customize them without losing quality. You can also combine different elements to create your own designs. To use the Aridi Vector Clipart Collection, you will need a vector graphics software, such as Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, or Inkscape. Here are some basic steps to get you started:
 
1. Download the CD or CDs that contain the images you want from the Internet Archive[^1^] or purchase them from Aridi Graphics[^3^]. You will need a software that can extract RAR files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip.
2. Open the extracted folder and locate the EPS files. These are the vector images that you can use in your projects. You can preview them using a software that can open EPS files, such as Adobe Acrobat Reader.
3. Open your vector graphics software and create a new document with the desired size and resolution. You can also use an existing document if you want to add the clipart to it.
4. Import or drag and drop the EPS file that you want to use into your document. You can also copy and paste it from another software.
5. Adjust the size, position, rotation, and color of the clipart as you wish. You can also use the tools and features of your software to modify the shape, outline, fill, transparency, and effects of the clipart.
6. Add text, backgrounds, and other elements to complete your design. You can also use multiple clipart images from different CDs to create a collage or a composition.
7. Save your document in the format that suits your purpose. You can also export it as an image file (such as JPG, PNG, or GIF) if you want to use it on the web or print it.

With these simple steps, you can create stunning designs using the Aridi Vector Clipart Collection. You can also find more tips and tutorials on how to use vector graphics software online or in books.
